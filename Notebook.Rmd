### Abstract <a name="abstract"></a>
This study investigates the efficacy of Virtual Reality (VR) as a therapeutic tool and compares it to traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Through an experiment, participants were assigned to either VR therapy (experimental group) or traditional CBT (control group) and their GAD and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores were assessed pre and post-treatment. Our statistical analysis focuses on comparing these scores to evaluate therapy effectiveness. 

### Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
As of 2019, approximately 301 million people globally suffer from anxiety disorders, characterized by persistent feelings of anxiety and fear. Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a promising therapeutic tool, offering immersive exposure experiences for controlled treatment. Studies demonstrate VR's effectiveness in reducing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and acrophobia, indicating its transformative potential in anxiety disorder treatments. Non-pharmacological therapies, notably Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, are commonly used for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), employing approaches like Imaginal Exposure Therapy and Stress Inoculation Training. Severity assessment often involves self-report mechanisms such as the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, both scaled from 0 to 10, contributing to a nuanced understanding of anxiety disorders and guiding tailored therapeutic interventions.

This study will look at the results of an experiment comparing GAD and STAI scores of patients treated using traditional CBT (Control Group) and VR Therapy (Experimental Group) to identify the degree to which VR therapy has an effect compartive to proven therapy techniques.


### Initial Inspection <a name="inspection"></a>

Initial inspection shows the same data types on both datasets. Patients are categorized by gender, and there are numeric scores for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). We have results both for pretrial testing and post trial testing. 

Our preliminary analysis shows consistency in data types and formats. The summary is showing some insight on how the data is distributed, which may indicate initial differences between both treatments. There are also some outliers visible within the minimum values that might need to be looked at during our cleaning process. We need to first understand if negative values are possible in this type of results and if they could skew our results to the wrong conclusions.

```{r echo=FALSE} 
# Display the first few rows of the datasets (Removes 3rd row which just shows data types)
# Ref for how to remove data types: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64734495/suppressing-the-column-classes-for-tibbles
```


```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE} 
cat(format(head(control_group))[-3L], sep = "\n") # Removed as only useful for first look
```


```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE} 
cat(format(head(experimental_group))[-3L], sep = "\n") # Removed as only useful for first look
```


<!-- Summary of the datasets -->
#### Summary of Control Group
```{r echo=FALSE} 
 summary(control_group)
```

#### Summary of Experimental Group
```{r echo=FALSE} 
 summary(experimental_group)
```

### Data Cleanup <a name="cleanup"></a>
```{r include=FALSE}
# Check for missing values
cntlMissingCount <- sum(is.na(control_group)) 
expMissingCount <- sum(is.na(experimental_group)) 

# Verifying data types 
cntlDataTypes <- str(control_group) 
expDataTypes <- str(experimental_group) 

```


During the data cleanup stage we checked for any missing values and found `r cntlMissingCount` missing values in the control group and `r expMissingCount` missing values in the experimental group meaning no participants need to be removed for lack of data.

We then verified the data types, ensuring that patient IDs were treated as character strings to avoid any numerical interpretation in our analyses, and that test results were appropriately handled as numeric values. This step was essential for accurate statistical computations.


#### Filtering values outside of test boundaries 
<!-- Filters each group to new dataset removing any results outside of what test results can be -->
<!-- GAD 0 - 21, STAI 20 - 80-->
```{r echo=FALSE}

# Converting PatientID numbers intro character strings to not get numerical data in the summary. 
control_group <- control_group %>% 
mutate(patientID = as.character(patientID))

control_group_cleaned <- control_group %>% filter(pretrial_GAD >= 0, pretrial_STAI >= 20, posttrial_GAD >= 0, posttrial_STAI >= 20, pretrial_GAD <= 21, pretrial_STAI <= 80, posttrial_GAD <= 21, posttrial_STAI <= 80)
```

``` {r echo=FALSE}

# Converting PatientID numbers intro character strings to not get numerical data in the summary. 
experimental_group <- experimental_group %>% 
mutate(patientID = as.character(patientID))

experimental_group_cleaned <- experimental_group %>% filter(pretrial_GAD >= 0, pretrial_STAI >= 0, posttrial_GAD >= 0, posttrial_STAI >= 0, , pretrial_GAD <= 21, pretrial_STAI <= 80, posttrial_GAD <= 21, posttrial_STAI <= 80) 
```

A key part of our cleanup involved filtering out test scores outside the boundaries for GAD (0-21) and STAI (20-80). This was necessary, as scores outside these ranges would not be considered clinically meaningful and could be attributed to typing error. After applying these filters, we reassessed the data to confirm that no outliers remained, which is clear in the summary minimum and maximum values. See [references for sources on test boundaries](#references)

Post-cleanup, our datasets present a more accurate reflection of the experiment results. Both control and experimental groups show data consistency, with no invalid values, and remained well distributed within the expected score ranges.This is a solid foundation for us to formulate our hypothesis. 

#### Summary of Control Group After Cleanup
``` {r echo=FALSE}
summary(control_group_cleaned) 
```

#### Summary of Experimental Group After Cleanup
``` {r echo=FALSE}
summary(experimental_group_cleaned) 
```

```{r include=FALSE}
count_control_cleaned <- count(control_group_cleaned)
count_experimental_cleaned <- count(experimental_group_cleaned)
```


### Hypothesis Formulation

After our initial inspection, more specifically after comparing the difference between means of pre-trial and post-trial scores for both GAD and STAI results, we have come to following hypotheses:

- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** VR-based therapy does not have a significant difference in effectiveness from traditional CBT therapy in treating Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).

- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** VR-based therapy is significantly more effective than traditional CBT therapy to threat Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).

The validation of these hypotheses will be through a statistical analysis of GAD and STAI scores from both the control (CBT) and experimental (VR) groups.


### Visual Inspection for Normality

In order to determine the kind of testing we will run for our hypotheses, we will first review our datasets more in depth and determine if they are normally distributed or not. This will educate our next steps. For this analysis we will do a visual inspection first using BoxPlots, histograms, density plots and QQ plots. 
``` {r echo=FALSE}
# Adding a 'group' column to each dataset, this is so we can combine them next and we can keep differentiating them. 
control_group_cleaned$group <- 'Control'
experimental_group_cleaned$group <- 'Experimental'

# Combining the datasets, this will help us compare the data in different plots.
combined_groups <- rbind(control_group_cleaned, experimental_group_cleaned)
```



#### Visualization of GAD results for pre-trial and post-trial groups

The boxplots provide an initial visual indication of the data's distribution. In the control group, the boxplot reveals a slight asymmetry in post-trial GAD scores, suggesting potential skewness. Comparatively, the experimental group's boxplot shows a more symmetric distribution, aligning closer with normality. 

```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}

# Visualizing the pre-trial GAD scores by group using a boxplot
ggplot(combined_groups, aes(x = group, y = pretrial_GAD, fill = group)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "black", outlier.shape = 8, outlier.size = 10) +
    labs(title = "Pre-Trial GAD Scores by Group", x = "Group", y = "Pre-Trial GAD Score")

control_pretrial_GAD_mean <- mean(control_group_cleaned$pretrial_GAD)
experimental_pretrial_GAD_mean <- mean(experimental_group_cleaned$pretrial_GAD)

cat("Control Pre Trial mean GAD score: ", control_pretrial_GAD_mean)
cat("Experimental Pre Trial mean GAD score: ", experimental_pretrial_GAD_mean, sep="\n")
```


```{r echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
# Visualizing the post-trial GAD scores by group using a boxplot
ggplot(combined_groups, aes(x = group, y = posttrial_GAD, fill = group)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "black", outlier.shape = 8, outlier.size = 10) +
    labs(title = "Post-Trial GAD Scores by Group", x = "Group", y = "Post-Trial GAD Score")

control_posttrial_GAD_mean <- mean(control_group_cleaned$posttrial_GAD)
experimental_posttrial_GAD_mean <- mean(experimental_group_cleaned$posttrial_GAD)

cat("Control Post Trial mean GAD score: ", control_posttrial_GAD_mean)
cat("Experimental Post Trial mean GAD score: ", experimental_posttrial_GAD_mean, sep="\n")
```

In this joint histograms and density plots we can look for the distribution curves of our data. The control group's pre-trial GAD scores exhibit a bell-shaped curve but with noticeable deviations, hinting at a non-normal distribution. In contrast, the experimental group's post-trial GAD scores display a more uniform bell shape, suggesting normality. The varying peak heights and spread of the histograms across different test scores highlight the diverse response patterns between the two groups.

### Method <a name="method"></a>
#### Hypothesis testings

Now that we have tested for normality, we can assume that all datasets are normally distributed, which allows us to proceed with parametric tests. Our focus is the change in scores from pretrial to posttrial within each group. To analyze this, we'll use paired T-tests, comparing pretrial and posttrial scores for each participant within the control and experimental groups. This allows us to assess the effect of each treatment type within the respective groups and establish a comparison for their effectiveness. 

```{r echo=FALSE}

# Calculate change in GAD scores
control_group_results <- control_group_cleaned$posttrial_GAD - control_group_cleaned$pretrial_GAD
experimental_group_results <- experimental_group_cleaned$posttrial_GAD - experimental_group_cleaned$pretrial_GAD

# Independent t-test for comparing changes between groups
t.test(control_group_results, experimental_group_results)

# Calculate change in STAI scores
control_group_results_STAI <- control_group_cleaned$posttrial_STAI - control_group_cleaned$pretrial_STAI
experimental_group_results_STAI <- experimental_group_cleaned$posttrial_STAI - experimental_group_cleaned$pretrial_STAI

# Independent t-test for comparing changes between groups
t.test(control_group_results_STAI, experimental_group_results_STAI)


```

### Results:

Our analysis, utilizing Welch's Two Sample t-tests, revealed a statistically significant difference in treatment effectiveness between the control group (CBT) and the experimental group (VR therapy) for both GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) scores.

For GAD scores, the p-value obtained was approximately 4.143e-10, which indicates an extremely low probability of observing the same difference by chance. This p-value strongly refutes the null hypothesis (H0) that VR-based therapy has no significant difference in effectiveness compared to traditional CBT therapy for GAD. The negative mean change in both groups reflects a decrease in GAD scores post-treatment, with the experimental group demonstrating a more substantial reduction.

Similarly, for STAI scores, the p-value obtained was approximately 9.28e-14, once again emphasizing a very low likelihood of obtaining these results by chance. This p-value also rejects the null hypothesis (H0) that there is no difference in effectiveness between the two treatment methods for reducing anxiety levels. The negative mean change in the experimental group indicates a reduction in anxiety levels, contrasting with the control group, where a negative value was not reached.

In summary, both extremely low p-values provide strong evidence that VR-based therapy is significantly more effective than traditional CBT therapy in reducing symptoms of Generalized Anxiety disorder.
