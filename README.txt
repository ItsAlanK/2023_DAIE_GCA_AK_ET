Data Analytics for Immersive Environments - Pair Project Virtual Reality(VR) Interventions: Evaluating Efficacy in the Treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder(GAD)

This study investigates the efficacy of Virtual Reality (VR) as a therapeutic tool and compares it to traditional Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Through an experiment, participants were assigned to either VR therapy (experimental group) or traditional CBT (control group) and their GAD and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores were assessed pre and post-treatment. Our statistical analysis focuses on comparing these scores to evaluate therapy effectiveness.
